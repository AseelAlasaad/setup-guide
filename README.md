# Computer Setup Instructions for Students Starting Classes at Code Fellows (or re-install)

**This setup should be done in a single session.**  Please allow a minimum of **1** hour to complete.

You do not need to understand what this process is doing. This is a vital step that will allow you to use technologies required throughout the Code Fellows' curriculum.

NOTE: You will be asked to download some stuff.  For this setup process please **right-click** on links to **open in a new tab** when asked to download and install.  This is so you don't lose your place. Example image below:
