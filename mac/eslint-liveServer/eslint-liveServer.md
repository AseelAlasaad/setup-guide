# Install ESLint and Live-Server

Run:

`npm -g i eslint git-open live-server`

You should see a lot of feedback as it installs.

After it has completed,  **run:**

`eslint --version`

Expected output:

```
v6.7.2
```

**run:**

`live-server --version`

Expected output:

```
live-server 1.2.1
```

Did you receive both expected outputs?

[Yes](../git/install-git.md)

[No](../../error/error.md)
