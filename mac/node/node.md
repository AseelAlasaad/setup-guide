# Install Nodejs

Run `brew install node`

It will take a few minutes for the download and installation process to complete.

After it is complete, run `node`

Type `5+5` and hit `enter`

The result should be `10`.  If you got `11` your computer is broken.

Quit node by pressing **control C** two times.

Run `node --version`

You should see something similar:

```
v10.16.0
```
